#CODE TO Deal with FILE LOCATION ISSUES
#ENSURE input file is in same folder as .py file.
""" To Make your code work with text files in same folder as the .py files regardless of environment and editor used:
use this code. (the import statement goes as the first line in your .py file, the rest goes where you do the file open and read, and replace the .txt with your filename
this assumes your input file is in same folder as .py file

import os.path   #first line up top in .py

filepath = os.path.dirname(__file__)
filename = os.path.join(filepath, 'test.txt')  # replace test.txt with what you need

with open(filename, 'r') etc..
